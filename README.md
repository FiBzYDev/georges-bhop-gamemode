# georges-bhop-gamemode
Georges Bunny Hop Gamemode from 2015

Info: I started Bunny Hoping on 2014 and this was GFL's top bhop gamemode of its time, this gamemode was privated I had paid George for this it was aboyt 68 USD at the time. This gamemode is very nostalgic and brings back very good memories of rhythm and a few others when we used to play.

- If you find if something is better coded feel free to use and edit your gamemode

What I edited: 
- Config for easy setting changes
- Custom CS:S Ammo Hud
- TAS Style (Slow Mo) and Others but works Normal on Replays
- Server Name Changer very few 3 seconds
